_**My adventure starts on 07/01/2022, the day I left my job to start and look for a new opportunity. I write this to summarize all my achievements after 2 months of free time learning.  
I always know that my achievements, my knowledge are not good as others, so in these two months, I have tried a lot. It's a pity that I cannot spend 100% of my free time learning. Some reasons come from my family stuff, some from myself. I was lost in video games and TV series. Poor me. :disappointed:
**_

## I. Let's talk about what I got first

### 1. 300 children's code challenges

</figure>

I start to solve the challenges in LeetCode and write post blogs to summarize the lesson learn about them.
After two months, I just finished 150+ challenges and completed 5 posts about algorithms, which is not the number I want. However, It is quite acceptable, cause these numbers are affected by my requirement and the way I learn.

#### How I learn with these

I start to learn with the LeetCode Explore, I really appreciate it. Cause it was summarized by the best of best. They have some traditional challenges and are easy to meet in an interview, They also sort them into subtopics, same as the kind of challenges, which you can easy to learn and understand.

For every challenge, I usually try and code all the solutions, and try to optimize them as much as possible. This way took me a lot of time, but that's okay.

When I solve the challenge in LeetCode, I figure out that I was missing a lot of better ways which can improve my last code. I wish I have a time machine. 
For example: When I come back with Binary Search in LeetCode, I wish I design my "fixed data" with increment index so can search it faster. Or just some hack syntax in the discussion I got

```typescript
    let uniqueList = [... new Set(["abcd", "abcd", "abcd"])];
```

It helps me save much time to remove duplicates in the string in an array.

There is plenty of syntax like that, but I only know about them when I play with LeetCode to get better performance. If you are a newbie like me, you should read the solution or discussion of the LeetCode challenge, you can learn from the source code of some master, It's worth it.

#### How I summarize

Actually, after practicing on LeetCode, I am still confused with some kind of challenges and I cannot distinguish them. So I start to classify and try to explain it in my [post](https://nhvu95.com/). Similar to Rubber Duck Debugging, I can remember faster and longer.

### 2. Trying new things, learning new knowledge, and relearning what was missing

Cause I am not starting at a specific position at the start. Like I join to work directly with Typescript, without going in deep in javascript. So I start to recheck and review all the missing.  
[**Prepare for a frontend interview**](https://nhvu95.com/blog/preparing-for-frontend-interview/)

And Instead of continuing in the front-end, following the project's requirement, I started to switch to work with Java and Spring Boot after the main skeleton was built by the Senior in a short time, cause this reason, It made me lack a few core concepts. So I start to investigate them.

[**Spring Core technology**](https://nhvu95.com/blog/spring-core-1/)

**I just example two posts above to tell about what I do, they are still not enough, I need to update it more. But at least, I know what I missing, and what I need to learn.**
All knowledge I learned was noted in some posts, I summarize knowledge from many sources, quote them and explain them and try to explain it one more time again for the reader, this way makes me get more understanding.

**I also try some technologies which I never had opportunities to use in my work. It's quite amazing, I will write about them in another post.**

### 3. Update my CV

Updating your CV and Preparing for the next interview is the best action to reflect on your past. As luck would have it, when I updated my CV, I notice that I am not a negative member.

* I do some stuff and got some achievements in my job.
* My colleagues recognize me and my contribution.
* My leader gave me the opportunity to showcase my skill and abilities.
* My proposal in a team meeting was considered and discussed. Some were applied in our project.
* I give positive emotion and motivation to everyone, support colleagues to finish their tasks.
...

It is not all, but these things in some way show that I am good enough.

### 4. Pet Project

#### Portfolio

One of my satisfiest projects is my [Portfolio](https://nhvu95.com/) website. When I felt tired with LeetCode, blog, or learning new knowledge, I start coding pet projects to relax.
The funny thing is that, when I am coding and learning new things, an idea about a new post blog comes, and then a vicious circle starts, I back to writing my blog.

During this time, I optimize my pet project to get better SEO scores, make it responsive for mobile, and update the UI to impress recruiters. I also try PWA to make my website and work web no internet and control cache. Which I never had an opportunity to try at my work.

#### Image Hosting

An idea came when I upload an image for my post blog, and I just wonder, how does "Imgur" work?
Can I make It better by resizing, compressing, and uploading it at the same time? Could I host my image by myself instead of using the Imgur server?

</figure>

All are worked. I designed a Database and used Spring Boot. My project also supports uploading for both the Imgur server and also my server.  
It supports resizing images and compressing the image the same as TinyPNG does. All the core source codes are completed, I am still lazy in integrating between client and server, and have no money to hire an VPS to host it:laughing:, so I still throw it there. Maybe I will finish it after I get a new job.

If you want to contribute for it, I really appreciate :laughing:

#### My completed project

Sometimes, I optimized the completed projects like [F2F](https://f2f.nhvu95.com/) and [SoundMemos](https://soundmemos.com/). Now it has better performance, and better load time.

## II. My disapointed

### 1. I have no strict plan for my free time

It helps me be more comfortable but made my result worse. I believe that I should make a strict plan, and stick it seriously.

### 2. I was distracted

I was distracted by video games, TV series, but they were great. :grin: It's worth it.

### 3. I was confused with my career path

When someone gives me a choice. I will go straight forward.
Some brothers said I should choose any path, and when I higher position on them I can switch to whatever I want. I had thought when I choose one, I lose myself, and if I choose without considering my career path carefully, I have to choose one time again.

My last choice is to become a full-stack engineer, not to show ability, Just to make my dream come true and do what I want, by my abilities. Now it goes real. And this time, the decision is more important, cause I have no time to go back.  

**I spent a week deciding that I will become an SA,** and the next fit position for me is Fullstack Engineer or Backend Engineer. Cause two next positions can help me to collect knowledge to become a SA in the next 5 years.
