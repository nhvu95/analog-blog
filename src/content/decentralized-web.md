_**The first time I heard about the Decentralized web was on the TV series Silicon Valley. Until recently, the event Russia started the war in Ukraine made me really think about it. 
We don't discuss the factors of this war on this topic, cause no matter the reason for it, civilians are always affected. And I hope that all the leaders can stay together and make a peaceful action instead.**_

## Why this topic come back to me?

When two sides banned each other from some fields, starting with financial, e-commerce, import/export, a lot of businesses and people from both sides were affected.
Until I wrote this post, some people on both sides cannot use their essential services like the internet, tv, deposit/withdraw their money, just because of the war they don't agree with and don't participate in.

Imagine that, websites and web services are not controlled by the government and any corporation, It runs for only purpose is for the better life of all humans, contributing their value to humans, and cannot be impacted or be affected by any country. These websites and these web services freedom as the human did. It's so great, right?.

## Main ideas of decentralized web

The core is the word "decentralized". "**Decentralized**" mean no centralized data hosting services anymore. But in real-life, almost every system is built with a client-server architecture. So  "**Decentralized web**" come true will reorganize the internet.

Instead, When no client-server, peer-to-peer infrastructure is used.

>Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.[1]

If you follow me for a while, I was created a [services](https://f2f.nhvu95.com/) which use P2P Connection to send file between browsers and no store your file in any hosting service.

## Web 3.0 and Decentralized web

People talk about the Decentralized web as a core of web 3.0 which begin to replace web 2.0 in the next few years. It will be a long story, and hard to come true. But who knows? Internet of years ago is so different from today. And let's see the next ten years.

## How decentralized web help we get the better life?

I believe when decentralized web come true.

* People don't need bank to deposit/withdraw money.
* No one can ban others from the internet just because the nationality.
* No ads are displayed on my device, or it only shows with the allowed, cause no corporation can control that.
* Your data store in your computer, and no one can take it from you. No server mean that your action not be collected and not be analyze by corporation.

....
There are plenty of positive points decentralized web brings to us. However, It also comes with some negative points. I believe the exchange is fine, cause it is worth it, and in some way, people will find a way to solve it or accept it.
